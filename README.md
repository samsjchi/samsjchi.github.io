# Portfolio Website: https://samchi.dev/

Built with JavaScript ES6, React, React Router, Babel, webpack, and Sass (using BEM architecture). Deployed using [this solution](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages) to host single page apps with GitHub Pages.

**Features:**

- Typewriter animation with recursive implementation
- Responsive project tile design with dynamic animation on scroll
- Lazy loading project tile images
- Dynamic color gradients on hover
- Tags indicating which tools/technologies were used in each project
- Responsive sidebars based on scroll position/direction
- A healthy dose of subtle UI animations
- Desktop/tablet/mobile versions 

**To Do:**

- Create individual project/case study pages (instead of just linking out to live link)
- Separate About section?
- Build out Photography section (IN PROGRESS)
- Day/night color switch
- Smooth, native-like page transitions/animations
- Cross-browser/cross-device/cross-platform testing (IN PROGRESS)
- More to come...
